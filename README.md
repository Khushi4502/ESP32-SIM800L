# ESP32 & SIM800L Basic Communication

This project demonstrates the basic communication setup between an ESP32 microcontroller and a SIM800L GSM/GPRS module. The setup enables the ESP32 to send and receive data over a cellular network, which can be used for applications such as sending SMS, making HTTP requests, or connecting to the internet.

## Features
- **Basic Wiring:** The ESP32 is connected to the SIM800L module using standard GPIO pins.
- **Code Implementation:** Simple Arduino code is used to initialize the SIM800L module, establish a serial connection, and perform basic tasks like sending SMS or connecting to the network.
- **Expandable:** This setup can be further expanded to include more complex operations like MQTT communication, GPS data retrieval (if supported), and remote control via SMS.

## Hardware Required
- **ESP32 Development Board**
- **SIM800L GSM/GPRS Module**
- **Connecting Wires**
- **Power Supply for SIM800L (3.7V - 4.2V)**

## Wiring
The wiring diagram shows how to connect the ESP32 and SIM800L module:
- **VCC** of SIM800L to **Vin** of ESP32 (provides 5V input)
- **GND** of SIM800L to **GND** of ESP32
- **TXD** of SIM800L to **RX2** (GPIO16) of ESP32
- **RXD** of SIM800L to **TX2** (GPIO17) of ESP32

## Software Requirements
- **Arduino IDE** with ESP32 Board Package installed

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
3. Select the correct ESP32 board and port.
4. Upload the code to your ESP32.
5. Monitor the Serial output to see the communication between ESP32 and SIM800L.
